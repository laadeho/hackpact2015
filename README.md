# hackpact2015
Codes from my participation in the SuperCollider hackpact2015

hosted at http://laad.com.mx/hackpact2015.html

	

	hackpact -> an agreement in order to generate and register something new each day during a determined amount of time; in this case it will last for 15 days, programming with SuperCollider.

	At the same time, with each new code, a new person will be invited to do the same;

	a day - > a code - > a guest
